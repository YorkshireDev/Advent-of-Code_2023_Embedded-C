# Advent of Code 2023 - Embedded C
Doing Advent of Code 2023 on a Raspberry Pi Pico using C and the Arduino IDE

## How do you get an answer?

I have a 1602 LCD that I connected to a Raspberry Pi Pico on a breadboard. On the first row I print the answer and on the second I print the time taken in milliseconds. I'll include a text file with each Day/Part of how long it takes, can you beat the 133MHz Cortex M0+? :P
